    <h3>Chrome</h3>
    <h4>Your Preferences</h4>
    <p>
        On the options page, you can choose your settings to change how List.it functions. The first option
        is to open List.it in a chrome addon popup instead of a separate window. This will make the List.it
        sidebar open up on the right side of your Chrome window and it won't always be visible.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second option will cause the List.it window to track the Chrome window. This means that the List.it
        window will stay on the left side of Chrome and if you move your main Chrome window, List.it will move
        with it. Just be aware that this option may use more power and drain your battery.
    </p>
    <h4>Additional Hotkeys</h4>
    <p>
        For your convenience, we've given you several keyboard shortcuts that you can use anywhere in Chrome.
        They have default shortcuts, but you can change these if you want. Go to chrome://extensions and scroll
        to the bottom of the page. There is a link for "Keyboard shortcuts" and there you can change the hotkeys
        listed below.
