# Words Of Wisdom #

## Chrome Extension ##

 * The background page is listed in getViews
 * `window` always refers to the window where the code was written (functions =
   closures).
 * Putting view classes in the background page makes them difficult to clean up
   (causing memory leaks).
    - It also makes window point to the background page (not good).
